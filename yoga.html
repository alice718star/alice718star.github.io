            <h2>Power your mind, body, and soul</h2>
            <p>Yoga focuses on balance, strength, and flexibility. Many years ago, I took a yoga class in high school and hated yoga due to my struggle with balance and flexibility. It was not until recently that my friend invited me to join, and yoga quickly become one of my favorite activities.</p>
            <p>In between my other workouts, yoga became my go-to activity, partly because I enjoy the stretch of certain poses and calmness finds me after every session.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Yoga</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be open to instructor feedback. A good yoga instructor would help you if they notice your alignment is off. It is important that you receive feedback to correct any bad habits.</li>
                    <li>Do not try to compete with other people who may be doing shoulder and headstands easily. There is usually a series of movements before reaching that final pose. Trying to do a shoulder stand in one go without any prior preparation can lead to injury.</li>
                    <li>Focus on your breathing. A big part of a lot of yoga classes is not just about downward-dogs and poses, it is about your breath, rhythm and awareness.</li>
                    <li>Check out online resources like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yoga">YouTube </a>for free yoga videos. <a href="https://yogawithadriene.com/">Yoga with Adriene</a> is another site with free yoga video series.</li>
                    <li>Do not eat heavy meals before class.</li>
