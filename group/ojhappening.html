                  What's NYC without the kids? Kids in NYC enjoy various amenities, events and activites throughout the year. Summer is one of the favorite seasons for NYC kids because they get to enjoy the outdoors. Raising 2 boys in NYC means being creative with time. Some of the activities we take advantage of include <strong>NYC playrounds,</strong> <strong>NYC Parks, </strong><strong>NYC Water Parks, </strong><strong>NYC street fairs </strong>and <strong>NYC amusement parks</strong></p>
