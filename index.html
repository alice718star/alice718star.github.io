            <h1>Exercise for All</h1>
            <h2>Working out is uncomplicated</h2>
            <p>Are you looking to exercise but you do not know where to begin? There are many different types of exercise to choose from. All you have to do is to stop making excuses for yourself. Before you know it, you have started including it into your routine!</p>
            <p>On this site, I have featured overviews of some of the forms of exercise, but they are in no way inclusive of all the different ways you can get a workout in. Examples of exercise can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Taking regular brisk walks around the neighborhood</li>
                <li>Going for a swim at the beach or community pool</li>
                <li>Biking or rollerblading</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Exercising does not have to be expensive. Youtube has a great selection of workout videos tailored to your interest.</p>

                <p>Don't give up when the going feels tough! Pushing hard forces your body to work harder that may help you meet your goals.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Engaging in various forms of exercise is a good way to keep it interesting so you don't have to do the same type of workout all the time. "Waking up" different muscle groups makes your body work harder and may help you meet your weight loss goals.</li>
                <li>Exercise is about making choices suitable for yourself and your goals. For example if you are a beginner yogi, focusing on your form, which prevents injury, is more important than trying to be as flexible as possible to "keep up" with seasoned yogis. Lifting weights is another example, for which you may see a need to use a lighter weight as to not to compromise on your form, and building up from there to get to the next heavier weight.</li>
